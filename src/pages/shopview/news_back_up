            <p class="page-text">There are some campaigns when we suddenly discover how much value the product/service adds to the life of the people using it.

In today's times, people have a short attention span of nearly 3 seconds on Digital Sphere. Offline marketing can help you enjoy larger attention span. Contrary to popular notion, you need not always spend big bucks to get this kind of an attention span.</p>

            <p class="page-text">There can be nothing as good as helping the poor in today's world. A couple of daysback, it was International Labour Day and I along with my friends was discussing a great deal of stuff to help the needy. Sadly, despite all our discussions, we didn't do anything for them. On the Labour Day itself, there was a lot of hullabaloo about being more sensitive and helpful towards the underprivileged on social networking sites and yet these discussions remained infertile. I feel, there is simply no use making noise about something you cannot do anything about. Our unfruitful talks and unproductive ideas do not change the fate of those who have to toil hard and still they barely get their both ends meet. Sad but true!</p>
